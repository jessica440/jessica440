(work in progress!)

### Hi, I'm Jessica ðŸ‘‹
I used to run my own independent ethical fashion brand, [CARBS]( https://www.wearcarbs.co.uk/ ). I now do this as a hobby at the weekends while I'm learning how to code!
(CARBS was featured in the Asos Fashion Discovery campaign and is stocked in three countries)

### Why Coding?
I enjoyed working in the fashion industry but was frustrated by the impact that fast fashion has ethically and on our environment ðŸŒ±  __(badly structured sentence!!)__

I started to develop my brand into customer led design and I wanted to give the option of a custom garment builder on my website. This is how I started learning to code (and I loved it more than running my own business!) 
I've also previously worked with the Shima Seiki and I was very interested in how tech works with fashion (it's an incredible piece of machinery!!)

### Tech
I love learning
I'm learning so much every week and I'm really proud of what I can now achieve
I love working on projects with others and being part of a team (**TEAMWORK!!!**)

### Ambition
I would love to work in a small team as a full stack developer. Working on group projects during FAC has. __(basically I've enjoyed working in small teams on FAC, I get to know every person well who I'm working with and that's important to me)__
A company with high ethics is my priority!
In five years time I'd love to be.... __(working on something that is important and does good in the world!!)__
